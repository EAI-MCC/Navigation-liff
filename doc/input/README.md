## indtrodution
Hierarchical `Data Format` (HDF) is a set of file formats (HDF4, HDF5) designed to `store and organize large amounts of data`. Originally developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, it is supported by The HDF Group, a non-profit corporation whose mission is to ensure continued development of HDF5 technologies and the continued accessibility of data stored in HDF.
HDF5 simplifies the file structure to include only two major types of object:
- Datasets, which are typed multidimensional arrays
- Groups, which are container structures that can hold datasets and other groups
